# Predicting the MIC of AMPs for particular strains using an AI-based model

We've developed is the result of collaborative efforts by the talented team at the National Central University(the DataBase Lab). Our project revolves around the prediction of critical parameters related to Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) against specific strains.

These notebooks represent the data preprocessing steps we've undertaken. This stage is vital as it ensures that our data is properly cleaned, formatted, and prepared for subsequent analysis.

These models, designed to accurately forecast crucial parameters of AMPs, have been constructed with great care. They leverage a multitude of protein descriptors, allowing us to gain deep insights into the interactions between AMPs and specific strains.

In summary, our project combines data science, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence to enhance our understanding of AMPs. Through data processing, innovative model development, and insightful protein descriptor extraction, we aim to provide valuable tools and insights for the scientific community, particularly in the field of drug development and antimicrobial research.
